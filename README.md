# Project-One-Front-End-Dev

## Our Project's Design Requirements

1. Have a search bar for lyrics
   - Provides results of potential songs (if only one move to next page)
2. Once song is determined provide the artist of song and relevant info
3. When artist is known a playlist of songs will be provided
4. If they click on a song from the playlist it will provide that songs lyric (maybe song link)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

- Use at least two server-side APIsLinks to an external site..

- Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.

- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

- Have a polished UI.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

- Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
