# Song Finder

# Description

A simple program that takes the user's input of a song lyric, line or rhyme and discerns which song it is, who the artist is, as well as displaying some of that artist's other songs/playlist. Have a tune stuck in your head? Then perhaps you should give this app a try!

## Purpose For Our App

It's an app designed for people who have a lyric or line stuck in their heads but can't figure out where it is from. This app will allow them to find out what the full song is and give them closure on the lyrics they keep looping in their heads, while also suggesting some alternative songs.

## Our Project's Design Requirements

1. Have a search bar for lyrics
   - Provides results of potential songs (if only one move to next page)
2. Once song is determined provide the artist of song and relevant info
3. When artist is known a playlist of songs will be provided
4. If they click on a song from the playlist it will provide that songs lyric (maybe song link)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

- Use at least two server-side APIsLinks to an external site..

- Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.

- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

- Have a polished UI.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

- Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
